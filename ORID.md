### Objective (What): What did we learn today
- Learnt various refactoring techniques such as extract, inline, move, organize, rename
- Identified code smells such as duplicated code, mysterious names, and mested loops.
- Learnt how to draw concept maps.

### Refective (Gut): Use one word to express your feelings about today's class
- Drawing concept maps makes me recall my memory of what we have learnt in this week and have a more clearer picture of what we have learnt.
- Blocker: Sometimes it is tricky to pinpoint where should we refactor our code.

### Interpretive (So What): What was the most meaningful aspect of this activity
- Refactoring is essential for maintaining clean, efficient code.
- Recognizing code smells helps in addressing potential issues in the future.
- Concept maps is important for us to understand the big picture of what we have learnt.

### Decisional (Now What): Where do you most want to apply what you have learned today
- Implement refactoring techniques in future coding projects and in the upcoming homework.
- Plan to create more concept maps for complex topics to let myself understanding more easily.
